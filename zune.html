    <p>My name is Lingyu Zhou. I am a <a href="https://khentmt.com">founder</a> as well as a student</a> at <a href="https://cornel.edu">Cornell University</a>, exploring the numbers and their connections behind.
        I also craft insightful data narratives from complex systems by blending applied mathematics and computer science technology.
        Previously, I studied applied mathematics at 
        <a href="https://wisc.edu"> University of Wisconsin-Madison</a> for my bachelor's degree.
    </p>

    <p>
        My research directions are applied mathematical modeling, applied statistics, and machine learning.
        My specialties are software engineering, math, data analysis, and data visualization.
        I am also interested in biology, botany, and etymology.  
    </p>

    <p>
        I am now working with <a href="https://seagrant.sunysb.edu/">New York Sea Grant</a> on flood data analysis. Previously I worked at the Technology Strategy Department in <a href="http://m.hoperun.com/news.html">Jiangsu Hoperun Software Co. Ltd.</a>, 
        where my main work involved data analysis on Apache Flink platform and IoT complex events processing based on MQTT protocol. 
        More information, including the source code about this program can be found <a href="https://github.com/xolyn/flinkmqtt">here</a>. Before joining Hoperun,
        I was a data operator at <a href="https://www.sino-technology.com/">Shanghai Sino Environmental Technology Co., Ltd</a>.
