## C1: Database Env. & Dev. Process
**Data**: Stored representations of meaningful of objects and events.

- Structured ~ : Numbers, characters, ...
- Unstructured ~ : Images, videos, audio, ...

**Information**: Processed data that are of a meaning to users.

**Metadata**: Data that describes the properties (name, type, etc.) or context (source, storage location, etc.) of end-user data; it is often the data about the structure that contain data.

**Database**: Organized collection of logically related data.

# 8.25
## Database approach
- Central storage of shared data
- Data is managed by a controling agent
- Stored in a standardized, convenient form (with the help of metadata)

-> DBMS

## DBMS
A software system that is used to create maintain, and provide controlled access to user databases.

Advantages:
- Program-data independence
- Planned data redundancy
- Improved data consistency
- Improved data sharing
- Increased application development productivity
- Enforcement of standards
- Improved data quality
- Improved data accessibility and responsiveness
- Reduced program maintence
- Improved decision support, profit, ...

Costs and risks:
- New specialized personnel
- Installation
- Conversion
- Need for explicit backup and recovery
- Organizational conflict

## Data model
**Entity**:

An object about which people want to maintain data. It is expressed as **noun** (capitalized), composed of **attributes**.

**Relationship**:

The association among the entities. It is described with a verb or verb phrase.

Relational Database:
A database that represents data as a collection of tables(relations) in which all data relationships are represented by common values.

Example of RDBMS:
- Oracle
- MS SQL Server
- MySQL
- DB2
- Sybase
- Teradata
- MS Access
- (PROC SQL)

## Enterprise database applications
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
- Data Warehouse

## 2 approaches to database and information system development
- System Development Life Cycles (SDLC)

    - Traditional, complete
    - Detailed, well-planned development process
    - Time-consuming but comprehensive
    - Long development cycle

    *Planning-Analysis-Logical Design-Physical Design-Implementation-Maintenance*

- Prototyping

    - Interactive 
    - Rapid application development
    - Cursory attempt at conceptual data modeling
    - Define database during development of initial prototype
    - Repeat implementation and maintenance activities w/ new prototype versions

## Database Schemas
- External Schema
    - User view
    - Subsets of conceptual schema
    - Can be determined from business-function
    - DBA determines schema for different users 
- Conceptual 
    - E-R models
- Internal Schema 
    - Logical structrues
    - Physical structrues

## C2: Modeling data in the organization
## Purpose of data modeling
To represent **business rules**, which in turn govern data, and then to enforce these rules through DB technologies.

**A good business rule is**:
- Declarative
- Precise
- Atomic
- Consistent
- Expressible
- Distinct
- Business-oriented

## Data definition
**Term**: Word or phrase with specific meaning for the business (e.g. course, flight)

**Fact**: Association between 2 or more terms (e.g. a customer rented a car)

**Guidelines for a good one**:
- Concise
- Gathered in conjuction 
- Accompained by diagrams
- Singular form
- Achieved by consensus, and iteratively refined

## Entity-relationship model
A logical representation of the data for an organization or for a business area, using entities for categories of data.

### Construct
- Entity: Often corresponds to a **table**
- Relationship: **Primary/foreign** key equivalencies in the related tables
- Attributes: A property or characteristic of an entity or rlsp. type and often corresponds to a **field** in a table.

### Software to create
- Microsoft Visio
- Oracle Designer
- HRT Notation
- CA ERwin 

## Entity
Should: 
- An object w/ many instances in the database
- An object that will be composed of multiple attribute

# 9.1
## E.g. 
**Entity: Employee**
*Attribute (Attribute data type)*:
- **Employee number** (Char)
- Name (Char)
- Addr. (Char)
- City (Char)
- State (Char)
- Zip code (Char)
- Date hired (Date)
- Birth Date (Date)

## Strong vs weak entities, and identifying relationship
Strong entity:
- Exists independently of other types of enetities.
- Has own identifiers.
- Entity box has a single line in E-R.

Weak entity:
- Dependent on a strong entity.
- Does not have own identifiers.
- Entity box has a double line in E-R.

Identifying relationship: link a strong entity to a weak one.

## Classification of attributes
- Identifier (Primary Key) ~ : 
    - Uniquely identifies individual instances of an entity.
    - <u>Underline</u> or **bold**
    - Candidate indentifier: Also could be a primary key and satisfies the req. for being an identifier.
    - **Criteria**:
      - Unique
      - Not null
      - Fixed numerically
      - Avoid intelligent identifier (Numbers have meaning)
- Required vs optional ~
- Simple vs composite ~
- Single-valued vs multivalued ~
- Stored vs derived ~

## Modeling the relationship
- 2 entities can have more than 1 type of relationship
- Associative entities

## Degree of relationship
- Unary
- Binary
- Ternary

# 9.6
## Cardinality
- Mandatory ~
- One optional, one mandatory
- Optional

## Associative Entity
An entity type that associates one or more entity types and contains attributes that are particular to the relationship between those entity instances.
- An entity with attributes
- A relationship-links entities together
