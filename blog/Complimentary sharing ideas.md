# Complimentary ideas sharing

Olibaba OSS has entered the termination of its life cycle. Although offering a decent price. The primal intention is still for storing objects, not webpage hosting and in my opinions, sharing of ideas via webpage should be, at least now, free. So, just now all of my websites are transferred to Cloudflare R2. Although it's still an object storage service, my website requires interaction with large files so it's a compromise for not using CF Pages. Anyway, again huge thanks to [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).

Hope to create more using this completely new website CMS!
